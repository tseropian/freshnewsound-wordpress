Change Log:
====================================================
Current version 4.3 supports WordPress 2.5.x only.
Version: 4.2 supports WordPress versions 2.1.x thru 2.3).



Version 4.3 - May 18, 2008
====================================================
Small fix to allow support for WordPress version 2.5.x release.



Version 4.2 - September 23, 2007
====================================================
Confirmed works with new WordPress 2.3 release.



Version 4.1 - June 21, 2007
====================================================
Plugin is completely localized. Current language packs: English (default), French and German.
Minor code clean up and enhancements. Confirmed works with new WordPress 2.2.1 release. 



Version 4.0.4 - May 30, 2007
====================================================
Fixed a small code validation error.



Version 4.0.3 - May 29, 2007
====================================================
Per a user feature request I added an option to the plugin admin menu so you can toggle on/off showing a link to your 
detailed monthly post archive (standard WordPress paged archives). Link appears below month link if toggled on.



Version 4.0.2 - released May 27, 2007
====================================================
Did a little code clean up so the archive output validates XHTML (pending your page template is valid). Per a user feature 
request I added an option to the plugin admin menu so you can toggle on/off the moo.fx for collapsing months (on by default).
If moo.fx is not enabled, your full archive display is shown but it's still using the caching function.



Version 4.0 and 4.0.1 - released May 25, 2007
====================================================
Major release. Once again the plugin code has been reworked from version 3.0.1. Added new features to the plugin admin page 
so you can toggle on/off showing total post count next to month (on by default) and toggle on/off showing total comment count 
next to post title (on by default). Added option to toggle on/off password protected post display (off by default). Added caching 
function which caches the output so the plugin only generates 1 or 2 queries each time the page is viewed. This version of the 
plugin is now moo.fx enhanced which means that for people who post a lot won't have an archive page that's 3 miles long.



Version 3.0.1 - released May 16, 2007
====================================================
Bug fix release. Fixed an error where unnecessary database queries were being made. Fixed issue with visual editor.
Other minor code optimizations.



Version 3.0 - released May 15, 2007
====================================================
Major release. Plugin code has been completely rewritten from version 2.1. New features and improvements 
include: SRG Clean Archives Admin Page, Toggle on and off (off by default) comment display (it use to be hard 
coded in the plugin), Streamlined code (less database queries). You can now create a dedicated archives page 
using the default WordPress page template from any theme.



Annoucement: New Plugin Developer - April 30, 2007

plugin development to GeekWithLaptop.com and iDunzo.com

comment count of comments that are in moderation.
